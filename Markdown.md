# Markdown on Github

## What is Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain-text-formatting syntax, often used for formatting readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor. It is important to understand and learn the syntax, which are the following:

1. Headings,
2. Styling Text,
3. Quotations,
4. Links,
5. Lists & Tasks,
6. Mentioning people & teams.

There are a lot more, but for now these are the basic essential ones as a beginner.

### Headings

In order to create a heading based on it's size, the hashtag comes in hand.
The number of hashtags # will determine the size from largest to smallest. (#>######)

### Styling Text

The following are several ways on how  to style a text:

- Bold (2starsTEXT2stars or 2underlineTEXT2underline; **TEXT**)
- Italic (1starTEXT1star or 1underlineTEXT1underline ; *TEXT8)
- Strikethrough (~ TEXT ~ attached ; ~TEXT~)
- Bold & Italic (2stars+1underlineTEXT2stars+1underline ; **_TEXT_**)
- All Bold & Italic (3starsTEXT3stars ; ***TEXT***)

### Quotations

The basic one is quoting a text by adding '>' before the text.

### Links

You can create an inline link by wrapping link text in brackets [ ], and then wrapping the URL in parentheses ( ). You can also use the keyboard shortcut command + k to create a link.

### Lists & Tasks

There are 2 different kinds of lists:

- Unrdered list,
- Ordered list

The *Unordered List* goes as follow:

- text 1
- text 2
- text 3
OR
• text 1
• text 2
• text 3

The *Ordered List* goes as follow:

1. text 1
2. text 2
3. text 3

There is also a *nested list* which goes as follow:

1. text 1
    - first nest
    - second nest

The task lists is to achieve a to do list and being able to mark it as a complete or incomplete task by using the hyphen followed by brackets with an 'x' or without. It would look like:

- [x] Finish my assignment
- [ ] Pass the course

You can get more details about [the listing and tasks](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-task-lists)

You can mention a person or team on GitHub by typing the @ and their username or team name. This will trigger a notification and bring their attention to the conversation.
