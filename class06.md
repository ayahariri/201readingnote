# Javascript Functions & HTML Dom Tree

## JavaScript & their functions

When calling a function that has parameters, we specify the values it should use in the parentheses that follow the name. Values in functions are called *arguments* and they can be provided as values or variables.

**Arguments as values** getArea(3, 5);
**Arguments as variables** wallWidth = 3 ; wallHeight = 5; getArea(wallWidth, wallHeight);

When a calcualtion has been done, usually you find a return; So it would go like:
function calculatedArea(width, height){
    var area = width * height;
    return area;
}
var wallOne = calculatedArea (3, 5);
var wallTwo = calculatedArea (8, 5);
}

You can also get *multiple* values out of a function by:
function getSize(width, height, depth){
    var area = width * height;

    vat volume = width * height * depth;
    var sizes = [area, volume];
    return sizes;
}
var areaOne = getSize (3,2,3) [0] ;

var volumeOne = getSize ( 3,2,3 ) [1] ;

## What is a Dom Tree

The Dom Tree is a model of a web page, that is stored in the browser's memory. It consists of 4 main types of *nodes*.

1. The Document Node
2. The Element Nodes
3. The Attribute Nodes
4. The Text Nodes

Accessing and updating the DOM tree involves two steps:

1. Locate the node that represents the element you want to work with. 2. Use its text content, child elements, and attributes.

Selecting an element from a nodelist have two ways, the *item method* and the *array syntax.*

**The item method** will return an individual  node from the Nodelist. Where the elemt, the length property and storing the first element come in hand. Example:

var elements = document.getElementsByClassName('hot') ;if (elements.length>= 1) {
var firstltem = elements.item(O); }

**The array syntax** is preferred over the item method because is it faster. Before selecting a node from the Nodelist, check that it does contain nodes. You will need to create a Nodelist, then if statements, then get the first element from the Nodelist. Example:

var elements = document.getElementsByClassName('hot') ;if (elements.length>= 1) {
var firstltem = elements.item(O); }

There are different things to select elements for the Nodes, such as:

- selecting elements using class attributes
- selecting elements by tag names
- selecting elements using CSS selectors


## The Problem Domain

The Problem Domain is the hardest part of programming to understand. The reason why problem domain is so hard, is because you canâ€™t really see what you are trying to build very clearly. Programming is easy if you understand the problem domain; so if understanding the problem domain is the hardest part of programming and you want to make programming easier, you can do one of two things:

1. Make the problem domain easier
2. Get better at understanding the problem domain
